# Known Issues #

* The `<<...>>` syntax can cause only the first `<` to be encoded as `<` if
  there is no trailing space (e.g. `<<something>>` vs. `<< something >>`). I
  suspect that I will have to manually look for any `<<` and convert them. I
  guess this is technically an issue with Markdown and not MultiMarkdown, but
  it has apparently not come up before.

* I tried to remove dependence on the `varwidth` package. This screws up the
  formatting of footnotes in tables, and also RTF exporting of tables. I'm not
  sure what to do - varwidth is incompatible with xcolor and is not a standard
  package. Suggestions welcome.

* Creating a link to an image by label doesn't work properly anymore

* I'm having difficulty with getting the glossary feature to work in the
  non-memoir classes. At some point I will look into this, but if someone else
  out there can point out what I'm doing wrong, let me know.

* RTF support currently only exists for Mac OS X. Conversion from XHTML to RTF
  happens via Apples `textutil` tool. It is possible to write an XSLT file 
  that converts from XHTML to RTF, but I have little to no interest in 
  writing this myself, as I don't really use the RTF format very often. If 
  someone were interested in developing this, I would help out. An added 
  benefit would be that the XSLT could actually do a better job than Apple's 
  tool in terms of footnote support and internal links.  Contact me if 
  you're interested. In the meantime, I suggest using [Google Docs][] to 
  import the XHTML file, and then export as an RTF.  It does a much better 
  job.

* The sample MMD file creates two copies of the footnote in the `MultiMarkdown
  vs. Crayons` table, even though I only call for one. Not sure where the `a`
  footnote comes from.... Any help in tracking this down would be appreciated,
  as it didn't used to do this.
