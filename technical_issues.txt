The MultiMarkdown system is actually a fairly complex group of programs, which
includes multiple perl utilities, a PHP program, and multiple XSLT files. With
some hand waving, I try to make it look like a single coherent program, but it
actually uses multiple utilities written by multiple people.

This section is designed to address some of these issues, and implications
they may have for users, programmers, etc.


## XML Namespace Issues ##

As of version 2.0.a3, there has been a complete overhaul of the way XML
namespaces are handled. This required changing all of the XSLT files to use an
"html" alias for the "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" namespace.

It appears to be working, including support for MathML.

If you have any custom XSLT files, you will need to make the same changes,
specifically:

Make your stylesheet declaration look like:

	<xsl:stylesheet
		xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
		xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
		version="1.0">

And relabel any references to XHTML elements, so that they are preceeded by "html:", e.g. 

	<xsl:template match="/">
		<xsl:apply-templates select="html/head"/>
		<xsl:apply-templates select="html/body"/>
		<xsl:call-template name="latex-footer"/>
	</xsl:template>

should look like this:

	<xsl:template match="/">
		<xsl:apply-templates select="html:html/html:head"/>
		<xsl:apply-templates select="html:html/html:body"/>
		<xsl:call-template name="latex-footer"/>
	</xsl:template>

I have left the `-novalid` and `-nonet` options in place to prevent
unnecessary errors when you are not connected to the internet, but these could
be removed if desired.

## XeLaTeX Tips ##

If you are using XeLaTeX to process your document (useful for utilizing Mac OS X fonts in your document), you want to use font declarations like this:

	\font\addressbold="Garamond Bold:mapping=tex-text" at 8pt

By including the ":mapping=tex-text" portion, you regain use of smart quotes, en- and em- dashes, etc.  I'm sure most XeLaTeX users know this, but it took me a bit of trial and error to discover it....
