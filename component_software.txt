# Component Software #

The MultiMarkdown system is actually a patchwork of multiple programs, which
are run in a specific order by shell scripts. I have written the glue
utilities, and the MultiMarkdown modifications to John Gruber's original
Markdown program, but I can't take credit for the rest.


## MultiMarkdown [MMD] ##

* by Fletcher T. Penney
* <http://fletcherpenney.net/MultiMarkdown>

MultiMarkdown is my update to John Gruber's
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) software. It is what
this bundle is based on. To learn more about why you would want to use this
bundle, check out the web page for MultiMarkdown.

## SmartyPants ##

* by John Gruber
* <http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/>

SmartyPants is another program by John Gruber, and is designed to add "smart"
typography to HTML documents, including proper quotes, dashes, and ellipses.
Additionally, there are several variations of the SmartyPants files to handle
different localizations (specifically, Dutch, French, German, and Swedish).
These localizations were provided by Joakim Hertze.

## Text::ASCIIMathML ##

* by Mark Nodine
* <http://search.cpan.org/~nodine/>

This perl module adds support for converting the ASCIIMathML syntax into
MathML markup suitable for inclusion in XHTML documents.

## ASCIIMathPHP (Deprecated)##

* by Kee-Lin Steven Chan
* <http://www.jcphysics.com/ASCIIMath/>

This bundle includes the MultiMarkdown specific variant of the original
ASCIIMathPHP. It allows you to use the ASCIIMath syntax to describe
mathematical formulas in plain text language.

This software has been replaced by Text::ASCIIMathML.

## XSLTMathML ##

* by Vasil Yaroshevich
* <http://www.raleigh.ru/MathML/mmltex/index.php?lang=en>

This bundle includes the MultiMarkdown specific variant of the original
XSLTMathML. It converts XHTML with MathML markup into LaTeX math environment
code. Very handy for making well typeset documents that are math-heavy.
