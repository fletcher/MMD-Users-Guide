# Applications That Support MultiMarkdown #

There are several applications and utilities out there that include support
for MultiMarkdown, that can make it even easier to create your output
documents.

If you know of something not included here, please let me know.


## Movable Type ##

MultiMarkdown can be used with Movable Type.  To install:

1. Place `MultiMarkdown.pl` in the `mt/plugins/Markdown` directory
2. Copy `ASCIIMathML.pm` into the same directory
3. Make sure `SmartyPants.pl` is also there

Now MultiMarkdown should be working with Movable Type. For some reason,
however, it seems somewhat temperamental at times. I haven't been able to
figure out why, but it works for me on my local machine and on my host's
server. It has also worked for other users.


## MultiMarkdown Drag and Drop ##

Early on, as MultiMarkdown became increasingly powerful (and complex) I
realized that most people would want something a little easier to use than
what had become a rather complicated command line string.

The first solution was a set of Drag and Drop applications created using
[Platypus]. These were designed to allow you to drop a MultiMarkdown text file
on the application icon, and they spit out a .xhtml, .pdf, .rtf, or .tex file,
depending on which application you used.

These utilities are still available, and have been updated to work with the
"Common" MultiMarkdown Installation:

## Scrivener ##

[Scrivener] is a:

> ... project management tool for writers that acts like your own
> little writing shed at the bottom of the garden, where you have
> cork notice-boards, ring-binders, photos, clippings paperclipped
> to jottings, notebooks and reams of typewritten pages piling up
> - along with a secretary who keeps it all in neat piles and uses
> his speed-reading skills to find what you need as soon as you need
> it. [#Blount][]

As of beta 3, Scrivener has the ability to export to a MultiMarkdown text
file, or to run the conversion utilities to create XHTML, RTF, or LaTeX files.
It also has support for MultiMarkdown metadata.

Scrivener's strengths, as they relate to MultiMarkdown, included the ability
to arrange and re-arrange your document as desired using its outliner view,
cork-board, and other features. It also has some limited ability to convert
RTF bold and italic formatting into MultiMarkdown syntax, which can be useful
when converting documents from other formats.

Scrivener is primarily focused towards creative writing, but when combined
with MultiMarkdown it is very useful for academic and technical writing where
a LaTeX file is highly desirable.

Keith Blount has done a great job with Scrivener, and I was happy to be able
to help implement support for MultiMarkdown. I look forward to helping to
continue to use and refine this program myself.

At this time, Scrivener is in public beta, and should be available for
purchase towards the end of 2006 or beginning of 2007. But the beta is very
usable as is, and gives you until Jan 2007 or so to try it out.

For more information, I have created a User's Guide to MultiMarkdown and
Scrivener:

## TextMate ##

[TextMate][] is a powerful text editor that:

> brings Apple's approach to operating systems into the world of text
> editors. By bridging UNIX underpinnings and GUI, TextMate cherry-picks
> the best of both worlds to the benefit of expert scripters and novice
> users alike....

> Created by a closet UNIX geek who was lured to the Mac platform by
> its ease of use and elegance, TextMate has been referred to as the
> culmination of Emacs and OS X and has resulted in countless requests
> for both a Windows and Linux port, but TextMate remains exclusive for
> the Mac, and that is how we like it![#macromates][]

TextMate is somewhere between a text editor for programmers, and a writing
tool. If you like being able to customize your writing environment, and like
fancy tools to handle the formatting for you, then TextMate might be the app
for you.

Allan Odgaard created an initial Bundle that added Markdown support to
TextMate. It included some basic MultiMarkdown support as well. But to be
honest, *I* had trouble getting it to work. And if I had difficulty, I can
only imagine how much trouble others had.

So I created my own Bundle. It includes a lot of features that automatically
format metadata, lists, tables, headers, etc. It can clean up the text to make
it look as presentable as possible in plain text, and it can then
automatically convert your text into XHTML, RTF, Word, or LaTeX/PDF.

I have subsequently rewritten this bundle as a fork of the original on github.
This should make it easier to incorporate changes, and possibly to merge the
two projects into a single bundle.

## Using Scrivener and TextMate Together ##

It is possible, using the "Edit in TextMate" feature from TextMate. Basically,
it adds the ability to edit any Cocoa based text editor view in TextMate. This
allows you to edit the text from a Scrivener document in TextMate, in order to
take advantage of the automatic formatting, while still retaining the
organizational features of Scrivener.

This feature has its limitations (it breaks the undo stack in Scrivener) and
is only for advanced users. I take no responsibility for it, as I didn't write
Scrivener or TextMate. But it can be useful...

## The "Common" MultiMarkdown approach ##

During beta testing of the MultiMarkdown support with Scrivener, it was
proposed that having a standard location for MultiMarkdown could make it easy
to integrate with various applications, and to allow the user a single place
to update their MultiMarkdown files, independent of the application it was
being used with.

For Mac OS X users, this boils down to allowing a MultiMarkdown installation
to be placed in one of two locations, where it is available to any application
that knows to look for it there:

* ~/Library/Application Support/MultiMarkdown

* /Library/Application Support/MultiMarkdown

The first is available only to the user, and the second is available to anyone
on that computer.

When Scrivener, or another application that supports this feature is run, it
checks to see if a MultiMarkdown installation is available in either of those
places. If not (the first time you run the program, for instance), then some
programs might install a version of MultiMarkdown here; others might simply
use an a copy of MultiMarkdown embedded within the application bundle.

The benefit of this approach is that if I update MultiMarkdown, you can simply
replace the updated files in the Application Support folder, without having to
update the other applications.

Please let me know if you have suggestions on improving this feature, or if
you are interested in including support for MultiMarkdown in your own
application.

Naturally, this approach only works with Mac OS X. If anyone is interested in
working on a similar feature for other operating systems, please let me know.

## Create Your Own ##

Between shell scripts, applescripting, Automator, and other tools, you can
usually find an easy way to incorporate MultiMarkdown into your own workflow.
If you find something that you think should be added here, let me know!
