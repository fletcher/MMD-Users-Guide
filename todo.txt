# Things to Do #

* Add a syntax to allow comments that can be stripped before passing the
  output to the parser

* write a routine (that would be separate from MultiMarkdown) to download
  linked images, save them to a tmp directory, and then convert them for use
  within a pdf.

* Decide on appropriate management of alignment when a cell spans multiple
  columns. Currently, the alignment of the first cell is used. (If Markdown
  goes to a whitespace-based alignment option, that could be used in this
  instance.)

* Consider whether there is a reasonable syntax for table cells that span
  multiple rows.

* Consider a syntax for superscripts (this has been discussed before) - could
  convert it to MathML syntax? Or just use math markup instead as described in
  [Superscripts].

* Certain markup gets processed within headers and shouldn't, e.g. `<img>`

* Consider whether to incorporate the definition list syntax into a footnote
  to specify a glossary entry (or perhaps even without the footnote), or
  whether to leave well enough alone.
